                    <p>Apart from being a machine learning engineer, I enjoy keeping fit and spending time outdoors with my family. Every morning I get up early to do gymnastics and stay in shape. On the weekends, my wife, young daughter, and I enjoy outdoor sports like hiking and exploring nature.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I also like to collect figures from 80's series, like Star Wars, Transformers, GI Joe, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Mazinger Z, Macross, Steel Jeeg, among others. When I'm at home, I like to watch sci-fi movies and TV shows and explore new technologies to stay inspired and motivated.</p>
